## Contributing

### Installation

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:netsells/crayon-cli
# cd into the directory
cd crayon-cli
# link the module for use elsewhere
npm link
```

### Creating commands

Commands can be generated with some basic boiletplate using the following command:

```bash
npm run make:command
```

The command will run through a few questions to generate some boilerplate to get you going.

The CLI is powered by (Caporal)[https://github.com/mattallty/Caporal.js] so visit the docs for details on how to put together new commands.
